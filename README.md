# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repository contains my solutions for the 2019 edition available on https://adventofcode.com/2019.

## The challenge

I'm currently taking a MATLAB programming class in uni, so I will first attempt to solve every puzzle in this language. However, I will probably fallback to Java or JavaScript (Node) for more complex puzzles.
